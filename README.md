# SuperCode Framework

A comprehensive AI-powered development framework that orchestrates specialized agents and tools for intelligent software engineering workflows.

## Overview

SuperCode is a sophisticated development framework that combines 21 specialized AI agents with multiple Model Context Protocol (MCP) integrations to provide intelligent assistance across the entire software development lifecycle. The framework follows evidence-based engineering principles and task-first methodologies.

## Core Components

### 🤖 Specialized Agents
- **System Architecture**: system-architect for design decisions and orchestration
- **Code Quality**: code-review, refactoring-expert, quality-engineer
- **Development**: backend-architect, frontend-architect, python-expert
- **Requirements**: requirements-analyst for specification and planning
- **Operations**: devops-architect for CI/CD and infrastructure
- **Research**: deep-research-agent with web search capabilities
- **Business**: business-panel-experts with 9 thought leaders
- **Documentation**: technical-writer for comprehensive docs
- **Security**: security-engineer for vulnerability analysis
- **Performance**: performance-engineer for optimization
- **Education**: learning-guide, socratic-mentor

### 🔧 MCP Integrations
- **Sequential Thinking**: Structured reasoning and planning
- **Context7**: Library documentation and API references
- **MorphLLM**: Fast code editing and application
- **Tavily**: Web search and content extraction
- **Chrome DevTools**: Browser automation and testing
- **Serena**: File system operations and project management

### 📋 Command Interface
25 specialized commands mapped to appropriate agents:
- `design`, `spawn`, `task` → system-architect
- `analyze` → code-review
- `implement` → multi-domain coordination
- `research` → deep-research-agent
- `document` → technical-writer
- `build`, `git` → devops-architect
- And 18 more specialized commands

## Key Features

### 🎯 Task-First Approach
- Understand → Plan → Execute → Validate
- Evidence-based reasoning over assumptions
- Parallel thinking for maximum efficiency

### 🏗️ Engineering Excellence
- SOLID principles and design patterns
- Systems thinking with ripple effect analysis
- Quality quadrants: functional, structural, performance, security

### 🔄 Intelligent Orchestration
- Dynamic agent selection based on task requirements
- Context awareness across sessions
- Multi-domain coordination for complex implementations

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd supercode

# Run the installation script
./install.sh
```

The installation script copies all configuration files to `~/.config/opencode/` and sets up the complete framework with agents, commands, and MCP integrations.

## Quick Start

1. **Load Project Context**: `/load` - Initialize project understanding
2. **Analyze Code**: `/analyze` - Comprehensive code review
3. **Design System**: `/design` - Architecture and component design
4. **Implement Features**: `/implement` - Multi-domain feature development
5. **Document**: `/document` - Generate comprehensive documentation

## Configuration

The framework is configured through `opencode.jsonc` with:
- MCP server configurations
- API key settings for external services
- Theme and interface preferences
- Agent and command mappings

## Philosophy

**Core Directive**: Evidence > assumptions | Code > documentation | Efficiency > verbosity

SuperCode emphasizes:
- **Data-driven decisions** based on measurements and testing
- **Preventive quality measures** with automated enforcement
- **Human-centered design** prioritizing user welfare and autonomy
- **Long-term perspective** balancing immediate and future trade-offs

## Architecture

The framework operates on a modular architecture where:
- **Commands** provide the user interface
- **Agents** contain specialized expertise and behaviors
- **MCPs** extend capabilities with external tools
- **Modes** adapt behavior for different contexts (brainstorming, research, orchestration)
