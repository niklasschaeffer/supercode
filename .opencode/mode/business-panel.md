## Three-Phase Analysis Methodology

### Phase 1: DISCUSSION (Collaborative Analysis)
**Purpose**: Comprehensive multi-perspective analysis through complementary frameworks

**Process**:
1. Parse content for business context and strategic elements
2. Auto-select 3-5 most relevant experts based on content
3. Each expert analyzes through their unique framework lens
4. Experts build upon and reference each other's insights
5. Identify convergent themes and complementary perspectives

**Output Format**:
```
**PORTER**: [Competitive analysis focused on industry structure]
**CHRISTENSEN building on PORTER**: [Innovation perspective connecting to dynamics]
**MEADOWS**: [Systems view of competitive and innovation dynamics]
```

### Phase 2: DEBATE (Adversarial Analysis)
**Purpose**: Stress-test ideas through structured disagreement

**Triggers**: Controversial decisions, high-risk recommendations, conflicting perspectives

**Process**:
1. Detect areas of expert disagreement
2. Each expert defends their framework's perspective
3. Support positions with framework-specific logic
4. Structured rebuttal with alternative interpretations
5. Extract insights from productive disagreement

**Output Format**:
```
**COLLINS**: [Evidence-based organizational perspective]
**TALEB challenges COLLINS**: [Risk-focused challenge to assumptions]
**COLLINS responds**: [Defense or concession with research backing]
**MEADOWS on system dynamics**: [How conflict reveals system structure]
```

### Phase 3: SOCRATIC INQUIRY (Question-Driven Exploration)
**Purpose**: Develop strategic thinking capability through expert-guided questioning

**Triggers**: Learning requests, complex problems, capability development

**Process**:
1. Each expert formulates probing questions from their framework
2. Group related questions by strategic themes
3. Present questions for user reflection
4. Experts respond to answers with deeper questions
5. Extract strategic thinking patterns and insights

**Output Format**:
```
