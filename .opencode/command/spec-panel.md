- **Specification Type**: Requirements, API, architecture, system spec
- **Completeness Analysis**: Identify gaps and missing elements
- **Quality Assessment**: Evaluate clarity, testability, consistency
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Validate business goals and user needs
- **Technical Feasibility**: Assess implementation practicality

**Quality Metrics**:
```
Clarity Score: 0-10 (language precision and understandability)
Completeness Score: 0-10 (coverage of essential elements)
Testability Score: 0-10 (measurability and validation capability)
Consistency Score: 0-10 (internal coherence, no contradictions)
```

### 3. REVIEW - Multi-Expert Analysis

Execute expert panel analysis using distinct methodologies:

**Analysis Modes**:

**Discussion Mode** (--mode discussion, default):
- Collaborative improvement through expert dialogue
- Sequential commentary building on previous insights
- Consensus building around critical improvements
- Collaborative solution development

**Example Output**:
```
WIEGERS: "The requirement 'SHALL handle failures gracefully' lacks specificity.
What constitutes graceful handling?"

NYGARD: "Building on Karl's point, we need specific failure modes: network
timeouts, service unavailable, rate limiting."

ADZIC: "Let's make this concrete:
  Given: Service timeout after 30 seconds
  When: Circuit breaker activates
  Then: Return cached response within 100ms"
```

**Critique Mode** (--mode critique):
- Systematic review with improvement suggestions
- Issue identification with severity classification
- Priority ranking based on impact and effort
- Quality metrics and validation criteria

**Example Output**:
```
=== REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS ===

WIEGERS - Requirements Quality:
‚ùå CRITICAL: Requirement R-001 lacks measurable acceptance criteria
üìù RECOMMENDATION: Replace "handle failures gracefully" with specific metrics
üéØ PRIORITY: High - Affects testability
üìä QUALITY IMPACT: +40% testability, +60% clarity

ADZIC - Specification Testability:
‚ö†Ô∏è MAJOR: No executable examples for complex behaviors
üìù RECOMMENDATION: Add Given/When/Then scenarios
üéØ PRIORITY: Medium - Improves understanding
üìä QUALITY IMPACT: +50% comprehensibility
```

**Socratic Mode** (--mode socratic):
- Learning-focused questioning
- Deep understanding development
- Assumption identification
- Alternative approach exploration

**Example Output**:
```
COCKBURN: "What is the fundamental problem this specification solves?"
WIEGERS: "Who are the primary stakeholders affected by these requirements?"
NYGARD: "What assumptions about deployment environment are you making?"
CRISPIN: "How would you validate this specification works correctly in production?"
```
