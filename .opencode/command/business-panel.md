### 1. ANALYZE - Business Context Assessment

Parse business content and identify strategic elements:

- **Document Type**: Strategic plan, market analysis, business model, competitive assessment
- **Strategic Themes**: Innovation, competition, growth, transformation, risk
- **Business Domain**: Technology, consumer, enterprise, healthcare, finance, etc.
- **Complexity Level**: Simple (single domain), Medium (cross-functional), Complex (system-wide)
- **Decision Context**: Planning, execution, crisis, transformation

**Content Classification**:
```
Strategic Planning ‚Üí Porter, Kim/Mauborgne, Collins, Meadows
Innovation Analysis ‚Üí Christensen, Drucker, Godin, Meadows
Market Assessment ‚Üí Porter, Christensen, Godin, Taleb
Business Model Design ‚Üí Christensen, Drucker, Kim/Mauborgne, Meadows
Risk Analysis ‚Üí Taleb, Meadows, Porter, Collins
Organizational Change ‚Üí Collins, Meadows, Drucker, Doumont
```

### 2. ASSEMBLE - Expert Selection

Select 3-5 most relevant experts based on content and focus:

**Auto-Selection Patterns**:

**Innovation Focus**:
- Primary: Christensen, Drucker
- Secondary: Meadows, Collins

**Strategy Focus**:
- Primary: Porter, Kim/Mauborgne
- Secondary: Collins, Taleb

**Marketing Focus**:
- Primary: Godin, Christensen
- Secondary: Doumont, Porter

**Risk Analysis**:
- Primary: Taleb, Meadows
- Secondary: Porter, Collins

**Systems Analysis**:
- Primary: Meadows, Drucker
- Secondary: Collins, Taleb

**Communication Focus**:
- Primary: Doumont, Godin
- Secondary: Drucker, Meadows

### 3. EXECUTE - Analysis Mode

Apply appropriate interaction mode based on content and context:

**Discussion Mode** (default):
- Collaborative analysis where experts build upon each other's insights
- Complementary frameworks creating comprehensive understanding
- Convergent insights and productive tensions
- System patterns and communication clarity

**Example Output**:
```
PORTER: "The five forces analysis reveals high competitive intensity
with low barriers to entry and significant buyer power."

CHRISTENSEN building on PORTER: "This competitive pressure creates
opportunity for disruptive innovation targeting overserved segments."

MEADOWS: "The system dynamics show a reinforcing loop: competition ‚Üí
price pressure ‚Üí consolidation ‚Üí reduced innovation."

DOUMONT: "Core message for board: Differentiate or consolidate -
competitive positioning is unsustainable."
```

**Debate Mode** (--mode debate):
- Adversarial analysis when experts disagree
- Challenge assumptions and stress-test ideas
- Structured rebuttal and evidence marshaling
- Synthesis through productive tension

**Example Output**:
```
COLLINS: "The data shows this company has potential to achieve
excellence through disciplined execution."

TALEB challenges COLLINS: "Your reliance on historical data ignores
black swan vulnerability. This strategy is fragile to unexpected shocks."

MEADOWS on system dynamics: "The debate reveals a tension between
optimization (Collins) and resilience (Taleb). The system needs both."
```

**Socratic Mode** (--mode socratic):
- Question-driven exploration for learning
- Progressive questioning based on responses
- Strategic thinking development
- Framework understanding deepening

**Example Output**:
```
CHRISTENSEN: "Before concluding innovation, what job is it hired to do?"
PORTER: "If successful, what prevents competitive copying?"
TALEB: "What happens if your key assumptions are wrong?"
GODIN: "Would your target tribe find this remarkable?"
MEADOWS: "What feedback loops would amplify or dampen success?"
```
