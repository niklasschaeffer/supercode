- Total: 324K effective tokens
- Average: ~15K tokens per command

## Transformation Patterns Applied

### Standard OpenCode Template
```markdown
---
name: command
description: One-line description
agent: specialized-agent
model: claude-sonnet-4-5  # for complex commands
---

# Command Action: $ARGUMENTS

You are [performing action] with [key characteristics].

## Project Context
**Structure**: @AGENTS.md
**Dynamic Context**: !`live commands`

## Request
**Target**: $ARGUMENTS

## Protocol
Execute [action] with 5-phase approach:
1. ANALYZE - Understanding
2-4. [Action phases]
5. DELIVER/VALIDATE

## Examples
[Concrete usage patterns]

---

**Execute [action] now with [key characteristics].**
```

### Special Patterns

**Serena MCP Integration**:
- load/save/reflect commands with deep Serena integration
- Memory operations explicitly documented
- Reflection tools (think_about_*) detailed

**Tavily MCP Research**:
- Parallel-first execution mandate
- Multi-hop exploration patterns
- Source credibility assessment
- Confidence scoring framework

**Multi-Persona Coordination**:
- brainstorm with architect, analyzer, frontend, backend, security, devops
- Context7/Magic/Serena integration for validation
- Socratic dialogue patterns

## Quality Metrics

| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| Commands Transformed | 21/25 (84%) |
| OpenCode Compliance | 100% |
| MCP Integration | 100% |
| Agent Specification | 100% |
| Context Injection | 100% |
| Execution Directives | 100% |

## Completion Recommendations

### Next Session Actions
1. **Complete workflow.md** - Partially done, needs final sections
2. **Transform select-tool.md** - MCP tool selection intelligence
3. **Transform spawn.md** - Meta-orchestration patterns
4. **Handle complex commands**:
   - business-panel.md (may need compression to ~200 lines)
   - spec-panel.md (may need compression to ~200 lines)
5. **Update help.md** - Add all new command descriptions

### Estimated Effort
- workflow.md completion: ~5K tokens
- select-tool.md: ~8K tokens
- spawn.md: ~10K tokens
- business-panel.md: ~15K tokens (with compression)
- spec-panel.md: ~15K tokens (with compression)
- help.md update: ~3K tokens
- **Total**: ~56K tokens (within next session budget)
